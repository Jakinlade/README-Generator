## Description


Code Examples
I have updated the generatePassword() function to ensure that the getPasswordOptions() function runs only when the "Generate Password" button is clicked.

## Code example
I added a feature to let the user select from a list of languages with a checkbox.
```
{
  type: "checkbox",
  message: "Which technologies were used in this project?",
  name: "technologies",
  choices: [
    "HTML",
    "CSS",
    "JavaScript",
    "Node.js",
    "React",
    "Python",
    "Ruby",
    "C++",
    "C#",
  ],
},
];
```
